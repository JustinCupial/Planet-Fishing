Cupial Games - Justin Cupial
Blackhole
This is my first VR project. This is very early on in the game, I've been working on this game on and off for about 1 month now and I like how its looking so far.

The Idea:
The game will be an arcade style point collecting game.
The premise is: You are a blackhole. Planets are flying past you and you have to hook them with your fishing pole and bring them into your blackhole to earn points.
This is a timed game. The Timer will be a star going supernova, once the star collapses thats when you're done.

What I need to work on:
I need to work on perfecting the fishing mechanic. Its really buggy right now, and Im not sure how to fix it but I will find a way to make it fun and easy to use.
I need to work on having an animation for the star going supernova.
I need to work on the score system and establish point values based on the planets you get.
I need to 3D model planets for my game.
